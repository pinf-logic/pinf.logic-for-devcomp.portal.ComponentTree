PINF.Logic for DeveloperCompanion ComponentTree Portal
======================================================

This project contains [WebComponents](http://webcomponents.org/) to manifest a UI for interacting with PINF.Logic within [DeveloperCompanion](https://github.com/devcomp/devcomp.org).

The *DeveloperCompanion ComponentTree Portal* organizes registred components into a tree based on a controling model. This project contains the implementation of such a model.

The model is focused on providing the following:

  * A single data model to capture all PINF.Logic aspects as they apply to web software development
  * A layout node component animated by the data model to create slots for registration of implementing components
  * A container to load and manage implementing components and provide a PINF.Logic context
  * A workflow that requires the assignment of every implementing component to a model-managed container
